# JavaScript 2 - MA3

![image]()

This is a simple overview of the use/purpose of the Module Assignment.

## Description

Create a login form that accepts a username and password.

When the form is submitted, add simple validation that checks that there is at least a value in each input.

If validation passes, make a request to your local Strapi API to login.

If the login is successful, store the returned JWT in localStorage and redirect to another page. It doesn't matter which page you redirect to.

If the login is not successful, display a message indicating that to the user.

This are some bullet points:

- HTML.
- CSS.
- Sass. 
- Js.
